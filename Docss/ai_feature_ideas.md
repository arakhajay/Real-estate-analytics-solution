# Brainstorming: AI Features for Beekin Analysis

## 1. For Asset Owners & Investors (Strategic Focus)
*Target: "I want to know my risk, my returns, and what to do next without digging into dashboards."*

### The "AI Investment Committee" (Extension of RAG idea)
*   **What it is:** A multi-agent chat interface where the user acts as the CEO, and 3 AI agents (Analyst, Risk Officer, Legal) debate a property's potential.
*   **Value:** Instead of just "data," the AI provides *opinions*.
*   **Example:** "Data says Rent is undervalued, but Risk AI warns that local 'Good Cause' eviction laws make raising it risky. Recommendation: Hold."

### "Virtual Deal Room" Simulator
*   **What it is:** A conversational "What-If" engine. The user speaks scenario changes instead of adjusting sliders.
*   **Value:** Instant sensitivity analysis.
*   **Example:** "What happens to my Net Operating Income (NOI) if utilities go up 10% and occupancy drops to 85% next year?" (AI visualizes the cash flow impact instantly).

### Automated "Memo Generator"
*   **What it is:** One-click generation of professional Investment Memos (PDF) for banks or partners.
*   **Value:** Saves hours of writing.
*   **Example:** AI pulls the latest valuations, market stats, and photos to write a 10-page "Q1 2026 Asset Report" ready for print.

## 2. For Property Managers (Operational Focus)
*Target: "I want to fix problems faster and keep tenants happy."*

### Smart Maintenance Triage (Vision AI)
*   **What it is:** Tenants upload a photo of an issue (e.g., a stain on the ceiling).
*   **Value:** AI identifies the problem ("Water leak"), assigns a severity score ("High"), estimates repair cost, and auto-drafts a work order for a plumber.

### "Lease Sentinel" (Legal RAG)
*   **What it is:** A semantic search engine across thousands of lease PDF documents.
*   **Value:** Answers complex compliance questions instantly.
*   **Example:** "Show me all tenants in the 'Northside' building whose leases expire in June *and* have a 'pet clause' exception."

### Tenant Sentiment & Churn Radar
*   **What it is:** Sentiment analysis on all incoming emails and support tickets.
*   **Value:** Predicts churn *before* the lease renewal notice.
*   **Example:** "Unit 402 sent 3 angry emails about noise this month. High risk of non-renewal. Suggested Action: Send a proactive 'Coffee on us' apology gift."

## 3. For Leasing Agents (Growth Focus)
*Target: "I want to screen tenants better and lease units faster."*

### The "Tenant Credit" Risk Analyzer
*   **What it is:** A composite risk score model.
*   **Value:** Goes beyond traditional credit score by analyzing "Rent-to-Income" ratio, stability of income source domain, and social data.
*   **Feature:** **"Fake Paystub Detector"** – uses Vision AI to detect photoshopped bank statements or paystubs.

### Generative Virtual Staging
*   **What it is:** Takes a photo of an empty unit and "fills" it with furniture based on the prospective tenant's vibe.
*   **Value:** Helps visualize living in the space.
*   **Example:** "Show this living room with 'Mid-Century Modern' furniture" -> AI generates the image overlay.

### Dynamic Pricing "Surge" Engine
*   **What it is:** Daily rent pricing updates based on real-time supply/demand (like airline tickets).
*   **Value:** Maximizes revenue per lease.
*   **Example:** "3 competitor units were leased yesterday; raise asking rent for Unit 101 by $50/month."

## Summary Recommendation
The **"AI Investment Committee"** is the most logical next step, building on your existing Deep Research Agents to create high-value, "wow" factor interactions for owners.
