# Vidur Gupta & Beekin: The Origin Story

## The Problem
Vidur Gupta, an investment banker turned real estate investor, realized the rental housing market was "data poor." While the stock market had high-frequency trading and deep analytics, real estate decisions were made on:
1.  **Gut Feeling:** "I think this area is up-and-coming."
2.  **Bad Data:** Using archaic spreadsheets and looking at "asking rents" (which are often fake) rather than "actual signed leases."
3.  **Inefficiency:** It would take analysts weeks to underwrite a portfolio that a machine could do in seconds.

## The Solution: Beekin
Vidur founded Beekin to be the "Moneyball for Rental Housing."
*   **Philosophy:** Use "Big Data" and "Granular Science." Instead of looking at a zip code average, look at the *block* or even the *building* level.
*   **Innovation:** They didn't just aggregate data; they focused on **behavioral** data (who stays? who pays?) rather than just physical data (how many bedrooms?).

## Key Takeaways for ASA Real Estate
To succeed, we must follow this "Moneyball" philosophy:
1.  **Granularity is King:** Don't just predict "New York rents." Predict "2-bed rents in building X with a south-facing view."
2.  **Behavior over Bricks:** The tenant is as important as the building. We must model tenant behavior (churn, risk).
3.  **Speed:** The competitive advantage is the *speed* of decision making.
